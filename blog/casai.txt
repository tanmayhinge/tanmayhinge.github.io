6:Teb7,
      <p>My experience at Casai marked a turning point in my professional career. Casai was a startup focused on real estate and short-term rentals, recognized as the largest real estate startup in Latin America, with operations in Mexico and Brazil. I worked there for four years, starting as an Android developer and progressing to become the tech lead of the mobile and web development teams.</p>

      <h2>Role and Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>At Casai, I led a multidisciplinary team composed of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 additional Android developer.</li>
        <li>2 frontend developers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We collaborated constantly with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 product designers.</li>
        <li>1 product owner, later replaced to continue development.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We followed the Agile Scrum methodology, which enabled effective communication and iterative value delivery.</p>

      <h2>Mobile Application Development</h2>
      <p>At Casai, I developed two Android applications:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Guest Application:</strong> Designed for customers to manage their reservations, communicate with the support team, and access relevant information about their stay.</li>
        <li><strong>Hotel Front Desk Application:</strong> Used internally by reception staff to manage guest check-ins and check-outs, as well as other operational tasks.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Both applications were developed using:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kotlin as the primary programming language.</li>
        <li>Retrofit and Room for backend communication and local data persistence.</li>
        <li>XML for user interfaces, adhering to Material Design guidelines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This experience allowed me to deepen my expertise in Material Design, creating visually appealing and functional interfaces.</p>

      <h2>Web Development with a Design System</h2>
      <p>In addition to mobile applications, I led the development of Casai's website. The site included a booking system and administrative functionalities, built with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>React and TypeScript.</li>
        <li>Styled Components.</li>
        <li>Bootstrap and Webpack.</li>
        <li>Storybook for implementing a design system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While the design system provided visual consistency, I later realized that maintaining complex infrastructure could hinder work in small teams. This lesson was crucial for simplifying systems in future projects.</p>

      <h2>Microservices and Backend</h2>
      <p>I also developed a microservice with Spring Boot and Kotlin to integrate the service desk with a queueing system. This microservice monitored and processed new reservations created on the platform. Although my involvement in AWS infrastructure was limited, I resolved critical bugs and ensured the service operated correctly.</p>

      <h2>Key Learnings and Achievements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Progressed from Android developer to tech lead, showcasing leadership and technical growth.</li>
        <li>Developed and maintained two critical Android applications, enhancing guest experience and operational efficiency.</li>
        <li>Led the development of a comprehensive website with booking and administrative capabilities.</li>
        <li>Gained valuable insights into the challenges of maintaining complex design systems in small teams.</li>
        <li>Expanded skill set to include microservice development and backend integration.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My time at Casai was instrumental in shaping my career, providing me with diverse experiences across mobile and web development, team leadership, and startup operations in the competitive real estate tech sector.</p>
