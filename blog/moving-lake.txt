6:Tff7,
      <p>My experience at Moving Lake was a pivotal phase in my career, where I worked on integrating and adapting legacy technology from Casai while continuously developing new features and enhancing visual design for client platforms. For approximately a year, I took on an integral role that spanned backend and frontend development while also leading technical aspects related to project quality and delivery.</p>

      <h2>Project 1: Vacation Rental System Legacy from Casai</h2>
      <p>After acquiring technology from Casai, my primary responsibility was to migrate and adapt the vacation rental system to Moving Lake's infrastructure. This project involved two global clients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kenya and Tanzania: Collaborated with a client to expand vacation rental operations in Africa.</li>
        <li>Argentina: Another client aimed to implement the system in Mexico and Argentina.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My contributions included:</h3>
      <h4>Frontend:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Refactoring the web system developed with:
          <ul>
            <li>React and Styled Components.</li>
            <li>TypeScript and Webpack.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Implementing visual and usability improvements to align the system with client expectations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Backend:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Developing and maintaining the backend using Django, ensuring seamless integration with the frontend.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Project Management:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Collaborated directly with clients (Product Owners) to gather requirements, prioritize features, and ensure timely deliveries.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>While a DevOps team handled the infrastructure, my focus was on complete backend and frontend development, as well as quality assurance testing.</p>

      <h2>Project 2: Sales Platform for Ofertacero</h2>
      <p>In this project, I contributed to the ongoing development of a sales platform for Oferta Cero, a client focused on product commercialization. My work centered on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding Visual Identity: Implemented the brand's visual identity using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.</li>
        <li>Developing New Features: Enhanced the platform's capabilities by making adjustments and adding new features.</li>
        <li>Bug Fixing: Ensured the system operated optimally by resolving technical issues that arose during its operation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Skills and Achievements</h2>
      <p>At Moving Lake, I worked independently on key projects, which allowed me to strengthen and apply skills in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full-Stack Development: Delivered high-quality, functional products by handling backend, frontend, and testing.</li>
        <li>International Collaboration: Worked with global clients across Africa and Latin America, tailoring solutions to different markets.</li>
        <li>Technical Project Management: Coordinated meetings, managed backlogs, and ensured on-time deliveries with Product Owners.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Integrating Legacy Technology: Adapting a system developed by another team to new technical standards was a significant challenge.</li>
        <li>Autonomous Work: Being responsible for the entire technical development process helped refine my organizational and technical skills.</li>
        <li>Visual Identity: Learned to translate branding concepts into functional and visually consistent interfaces.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The vacation rental system was successfully migrated and adapted, enabling clients to expand their operations in different regions.</li>
        <li>The Oferta Cero sales platform significantly improved its visual identity and functionality, meeting client expectations.</li>
        <li>I solidified my technical expertise in React, Next.js, Django, Styled Components, and Tailwind CSS, establishing myself as a comprehensive full-stack developer.</li>
      </ul>
